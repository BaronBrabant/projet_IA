def movement(dico2, list_position_earth, movement_input):
    '''
    This function will take the desired movement_input, will check if the inputed position of the wanted ant is correct by checking
    its position in the list_position_earth and will finally allow the player to move its ant to the desired position if it does 
    not infringe any game rules such as moving onto a squre filled with earth while already carrying some through the dico2.
    If the movement is succesful the list inputed as the list_position_earth will be updated with the new game coordinates.

    Parameters
    __________

    dico2 : dictionary containing information on the ant such as its health and if it is carrying earth or not (dict)
    list_position_earth : this is the list containing information on what is happening on every square of the map (list)

    interpreted by the game to execute orders and send the order to the correct function to be executed.
